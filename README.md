# Exploratory Data Analysis
# Best Songs on Spotify (2000-2023)
 
# About Dataset
I made this dataset for a fourth year Artificial Intelligence course by collecting the top 100 songs for every year on Spotify, starting from 2000 until 2023. The goal was to make a Neural Network for some multi-class classification task and I thought it would be cool if I could predict how popular a song will be given its feature set.
